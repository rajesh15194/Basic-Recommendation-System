In this recommendation system I am constructing:
(i) A basic recommendation system that will recommend the 10 top discounted products out of the total 20,000 products.
(ii) A content based recommendation system(basically a keyword specific recommender system where keywords are used to describe the items)

Cosine similarity- Cosine similarity is one of the metrics that we can use when calculating similarity, between users or contents. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
